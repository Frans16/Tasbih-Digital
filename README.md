In the automation testing process, I am using Selenium. The automated process involves increasing count, decreasing count, and resetting count. Within this process, I also perform verification for the decrease count and reset count actions. The verification ensures that the count decreases after the decrease operation and confirms that the count returns to 0 after the reset operation.

To execute this automation, simply: 
Right-click on the project and select Run as "JUnit Test"
